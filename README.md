# Toyhouse Custom CSS Disabler
A super-simple extension for your browser that allows you to toggle custom Toyhouse page styles on and off with the push of a button!

Currently only supports Chrone, but will (maybe) eventually support Firefox.

## Installation
I don't want to pay for the Google license fee, so you'll have to load this extension manually:
1. Navigate to the Releases page and download the latest release
2. Extract the ZIP
3. Open Chrome, and navigate to the "Manage Extensions" window (chrome://extensions/)
4. Toggle "Developer Mode" in the top right corner
5. Select "Load Unpacked" and navigate to the extension's directory.

If successful, a new entry in your extensions window labelled "Toyhouse Custom CSS Disabler" should appear!
